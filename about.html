                        <p>
                              My name is Adéla, and I create handcrafted raw vegan cakes made from natural, plant-based ingredients.
                              What started as a personal passion in simple, conscious food has gradually grown into a small, carefully run side
                              business. I focus on preparing vegan desserts that are not baked, made without added sugar, or additives.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                              Each cake is made by hand in small batches, using ingredients such as nuts, dates, cacao, coconut, and spices. I pay
                              close attention to the composition of each layer, allowing the natural taste of the ingredients to stand out.
                         </p>

                         <p>
                              At the moment, my cakes are supplied locally, with the aim of growing intentionally and sustainably. My goal is to work
                              closely with cafés and restaurants that value quality, transparency, and plant-based cuisine, while continuing to
                              develop new recipes and flavours along the way.
                         </p>
